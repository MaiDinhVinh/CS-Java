###Synchronized Method###
Exp context: bank account and worker
	acct: 100
	5 workers, each collect 10 for 10 times -> total 500
	finally, acct: 600

Exp how to shutdown ExecutorService properly

==>acct is not guaranteed to be 600.

***What goes wrong?***
Concurrency issue

Exp slide 51 by using 2 threads for demonstration

slide 54: Coordinating threads
	synchronized keyword to protect shared resources

exp BankAccountSM.java (diff if needed)  to show synchronized method
	not much difference in WorkerSM.java


###Synchronized Block###
exp context: 
	bankaccount with withdrawal
	promoworker: if deposit > 500, get 10% of surplus
	2 promoworkers run in main

==> not always the same result
==> synchronized method is not enough
==> synchronized block

Exp PromoWorkerSB.java
	synchronized(account): lock account for 1 worker at a time

Diff PromoWorker and PromoWorkerSB if needed
