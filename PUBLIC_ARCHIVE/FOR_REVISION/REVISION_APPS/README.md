**Some note when using the McGrawHill Interactive apps**
- To install the app, go to the "how to run.docx" file to get the download link (dont worry, it is google drive link tho :v)
- Make sure to read the "how to run.docx" file first since it contains necessary docs for some weird case with resolution (if you use MacOS !!!)
